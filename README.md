# ExtendDaysMod
A Lethal Company mod that dynamically extends the deadline based on your profit quota.

For every **$200** earned in the quota, you gain **+1 day** to complete the deadline (up to a maximum of **5 extra days**). This gives players more time to complete higher quotas and encourages pushing limits.

Compatible with V47 and all other mods (i think).

Any issue or bug, pls tell me!
